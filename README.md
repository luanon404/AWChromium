# AWChromium (fixing)

Android WebView separated from Chromium source code.

# Note

- Google vs this project: 😁😁😁
- Me vs this project: 👁️👄👁️
- Don't convert Java code to Kotlin if the class starts with '@JNINamespace'.
- Don't delete functions start with 'CalledByNative'.

# Goal

- Convert all Java code to Kotlin for easier processing.
