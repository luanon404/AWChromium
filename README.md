# Note

- Current WebView version: [120.0.6076.4](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/refs/tags/120.0.6076.4).
- Do not modify classes or functions with the `@JNINamespace` or `@CalledByNative` annotations.

# Goal

- Create `important.json` that includes only the necessary files.
- I'm trying to remove as many unnecessary files as possible.
- That will minimize errors that I cannot fix it🫣.
- “~~If there are somethings that u cant fix it, just delete it~~”

# Update Instructions

- Each version will include at least 3 releases:

| Release | To-Do                                              |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|
| CP      | Copy and paste the new source into the old source. |
| 3R      | Review, reformat, and remove unused resources.     |
| TR      | Testing and release.                               |
