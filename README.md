# AWChromium (fixing)

Android WebView separated from Chromium source code.

# Note

- Google vs this project: 😁😁😁
- Me vs this project: 👁️👄👁️
- Do not convert Java classes to Kotlin with '@JNINamespace' annotation (maybe that annotation only see Java class but Kotlin not).
- Do not remove functions with '@CalledByNative' annotation.

# Goal

- Convert all Java code to Kotlin for easier processing.
